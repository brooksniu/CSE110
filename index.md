# Hi, I'm Brooks.
## About me
My name is Brooks(Ruijia) Niu and I am a third year computer science & cogsci double major student in Marshall college at UCSD. I am interested in machine learning and have been working on several projects such as gesture recognition and generative neural networks. Feel free to contact me if you have similar interests! Aside of the academic stuff, I love ping pong and sci-fi movies. ~~Also I play first person shooter games **a lot**~~. 

## Things I have been working on

In the words of a lot of people:

 I did the data processing and visualization part and helped a little on building and training the neural network.
